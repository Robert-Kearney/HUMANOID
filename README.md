# NEUMAN
NEUromechanics and MOovement ANalysis Package
Joint neuromechanics describes the relationship between the joint torques and movements. It can be due to the passive mechanical properties of the joint and active neural activation by spinally (or supraspinally)-mediated mechanisms. Joint neuromechanics is a complex system that arises from a complicated interaction of dynamic, nonlinear elements including muscles, tendons, and neural circuits. The system has limited non-invasive observability and exhibits time-varying behaviour during functional tasks, which further necessitates the use of advanced data analysis and modeling techniques.
In this project, we propose to develop the NEUromechanics and MOvement Analysis toolbox.. This project will comprise tools for identification of different components of joint neuromechanics in time-invariant and time-varying conditions, analysis of EMG signals and actigraphy data. We will achieve this through a combination of 
  a) developing new code,
  b) integrating Python packages that contain the required numerical and data analysis methods, 
  c) porting code from other languages,
  d) making code customizations to address specific needs of neuromechanics data analysis, 
  e) developing graphical user interfaces, and 
  f) developing a neuromechanics data repository as a stepping stone to standardize maintenance and sharing of human movement and neuromechanics data for testing, validation and exploration purposes.
